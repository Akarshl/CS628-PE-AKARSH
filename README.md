The program accepts user data as input such as name, contact information, education background, technical skills, work experience, and project details. This input is gathered in a user-friendly interface designed to ensure accurate data entry.

Once the user submits the form, the program processes the input data by validating each field to ensure correctness and completeness. It then organizes the information into designated sections of a resume template, formatting it according to predefined styles in CSS. The React component handles the resume dynamically, allowing for real-time updates and modifications based on user input.

The final output is a well formatted resume displayed on the web page. Users can download their resumes in various formats, so that they can easily share their qualifications and experiences with employers.
